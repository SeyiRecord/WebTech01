                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Google Play, formerly known as the Android Market, is a digital application distribution platform for Android and an online electronics store developed and maintained by Google.
                &nbsp; &nbsp; The service allows users to browse and download music, magazines, books, movies, television programs, and applications published through Google. </p>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Users can also purchase Chromebooks and Google Nexus-branded mobile devices through Google Play.
                Applications are available either for free or at a cost.  </p>
                <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; They can be downloaded directly to an Android or Google TV device through the Play Store mobile app, or by deploying the application to a device from the Google Play website.[1] </p>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; These applications are generally targeted to users based on a particular hardware attribute of their device, such as a motion sensor (for motion-dependent games) or a front-facing camera (for online video calling).
                On March 6, 2012, with the merging of the Android Market and Google Music, the service was renamed Google Play to coincide with the rebranding of Google's digital distribution </p>
